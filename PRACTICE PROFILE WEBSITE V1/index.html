        I have attended TrueCoders Full Stack Software Engineering Program and spent over 500 hours of
        intensive, project-based training in programming languages and other technical skills such as
        C#, .NET Core, MySQL, Git, ASP.NET, MVC, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These skills were developed by 
        building multiple C#, ASP.NET and MySQL projects. All projects were tracked by using Git and GitHub 
        for source control.

        Currently I am an empployee of Humana and part of XC Academy's Internship program where I am sharpening my
        skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as learning Node JS and React. Equally important, I am also 
        learning the importance of collaborating with others and working as a team by mutually sharing ideas and 
        working on various projects. I look forward to being able be a part of a company where I can use utilize 
        the skills that I am developing. I hope to continue to build my strength as a teamplayer and be an asset, 
        helping with the improvement, efficiency and growth of my future employer.
